# Start up

Pledg's dashboard allows you to configure your means of payment and track the payments made to your various accounts.

## Account creation - first connection

If you do not have an account, you can create one at [test dashboard (staging)](https://staging.dashboard.ecard.pledg.co/#/).

When integration is complete, you can request activation of your account at support@pledg.co, and we will give you access to your [production dashboard](https://dashboard.ecard.pledg.co/#/).

### Viewing the details of a payment

Click on the eye of the payment you want to view.

![Capture_PurchaseDetailMain_Red.png](../../assets/guide/Capture_PurchaseDetailMain_Red.png)

The main features of the payment are followed by the sections :

* **Detail** :																							 
  - Date: the date on which the transaction was made
  - Reference: the reference transmitted to Pledg from your merchant site.
  - Transfer ("transfer" mode only): the reference of the transfer made to the merchant to pay for the purchase.
  - Virtual card (only for `back` and `front` modes): the status of the virtual card with our bank. The meaning of the status is detailed below :
  
| Status | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `AUTHORIZED ON TIME` | the bank received a request for authorization from the merchant within 3 minutes of the card generation | |
| `NOT_AUTHORIZED_ON_TIME` | the bank did not receive any authorisation request from the merchant even after 3 minutes |
| `AUTHORIZED` | the bank received a request for authorization from the merchant |
| `DEBITED` | the bank has received a debit request from the merchant |
| `DEBITED_LOWER_AMOUNT` | the bank has received a request from the merchant to debit an amount less than the authorised amount |
| `DEBITED_GREATER_AMOUNT` | the bank has received a debit request from the merchant for an amount greater than the authorised amount |
| `NOT DEBITED` | the bank has received a debit request from the merchant for an amount greater than the authorised amount |
| `CREDITED` | the bank received a credit application from the merchant |

![Capture_PurchaseDetail_Term_2.PNG](../../assets/guide/Capture_PurchaseDetailEcheance_2.PNG)

* **Refunds / Refunds**

Partial or full refunds can be made on payment. You have the option of monitoring the status of refunds or making a refund request for accounts set up in transfer mode.

![Capture_PurchaseDetailRefund.PNG](../../assets/guide/Capture_PurchaseDetailRefund.PNG)

If repayments have been made, the list of repayment transactions is displayed.

![Capture_Refund_List.PNG](../../assets/guide/Capture_Refund_List.PNG)

To refund a customer, the operation is different between the modes using a virtual card (front and back) and the "transfer" mode:

* Front and back mode (with virtual card): connect to your PSP (Payment Service Provider) and re-credit the virtual card; the customer's bank card will be re-credited afterwards.
* Mode `transfer`: the claim is made from the dashbord Pledg :

    - Click on the button "Request a refund".
    - Fill in the amount you want to reimburse
    - Click on "Request a refund"; a notification will tell you that the refund has been taken into account.

![Capture_Refund_Demand.PNG](../../assets/guide/Capture_Refund_Demande.PNG)

**Notes concerning the `transfer` mode
::: tip
To refund the **full** amount of a customer's order, you must fill in the total amount of the customer's order; If you fill in the amount corresponding to the due dates drawn, this will correspond to a partial refund and the other due dates will be debited.
To refund **partially** a customer's order, enter the amount you want to refund. This partial request will not necessarily produce a credit on the customer's credit card. The amount you want to refund will reduce or cancel the customer's most distant debit dates in priority.
:::

::: tip
Refunds are usually effective at **D+1** and will appear at that time in the payment refund list in the dashboard.

## View latest transfers

For accounts set up in `transfer' mode, i.e. a daily transfer is sent to the merchant for an amount corresponding to all the orders of the day, the list of transfers made can be consulted.

This section allows you to reconcile the payment of your orders with the transfers you receive on your bank account.

![Capture_Last_Red.png](../../assets/guide/Capture_DerniersVirements_Red.png)

Information:

* Amount: the amount of the transfer
* Status: `sent` when the transfer has been successfully issued
* Reference: the reference of the transfer transmitted
* Date: the date of the transfer

Click on the "View All" button to see a list of all transfers. You can then view the details of a transfer with a list of the orders concerned.

![Capture_Last_Transfers_Details_Red.png](../../assets/guide/Capture_DerniersVirements_Details_Red.png)

In the "Payments" section, you can consult the list of corresponding orders and the reference you have sent to Pledg.

When the amount is negative, this corresponds to a refund. When you make a refund request, we take the refund amount from your bank account and credit the customer's credit card.
