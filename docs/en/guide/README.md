# Introduction

Pledg offers multi-payment and deferred payment solutions for e-merchants.

The solution can be integrated on the payment page of e-merchants:

- via a [Javascript plugin](../plugin/README.md)
- via a [redirection to the Pledg payment page](../plugin/integration.md#direct-call-of-the-pledg-front)
- via [modules](/modules/) that can be integrated on the main e-commerce platforms

You can also create [payment links](payment-link.md).

To use Pledg you must:

1. Create a test account (staging environment) by registering on the [dashboard](quickstart.md).
2. Test the integration of Pledg.
3. Once the solution is running in the test environment, request the activation of the solution in the production environment by sending an email to support@pledg.co. We will reply within 2 working hours.
